## GT Immerse Hackathon

This project was developed in just **36 hours** as a solo dev initiative during the GT Immerse Hackathon. Inspired by the hackathon theme **"Illuminate"**, I set out to build a platform that harnesses the power of conscious thought and innovative AR to cut through the digital noise.

## MVP & Design Strategy

The minimal viable product (MVP) of AURO follows a simple three-color strategy to help users prioritize their ideas:
- **Red:** Ideas of least importance.
- **Yellow:** Mid-level priority ideas.
- **Green:** High-priority ideas that are ready to be pursued.

This intuitive color-coded approach supports users in sifting through a myriad of thoughts to uncover the ideas that matter most.

During development, I integrated a range of innovative tools and platforms:
- **Lens Studio:** To bring AR experiences to life.
- **Snapchat Spectacles:** For immersive, on-the-go AR visualization.
- **ChatGPT & Cursor:** AI-driven tools that aided in rapid ideation.
